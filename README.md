LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:

    Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
    Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:

    Components: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
    Off-the-shelf chains: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to customize existing chains or build new ones.
